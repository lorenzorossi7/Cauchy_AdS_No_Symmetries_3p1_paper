\begin{abstract}
We present the first proof-of-principle Cauchy evolutions of asymptotically AdS spacetimes with no symmetries.
We use a numerical scheme that is based on the generalized harmonic form of the Einstein equations expressed in Cartesian coordinates.
For this first study, we perform 3+1 simulations of four dimensional spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant, using initial data sourced by a massless scalar field.
We demonstrate stable and convergent Cauchy evolution of horizonless data, as well as data that undergoes gravitational collapse.
The main difficulty in removing all symmetry restrictions in this setting is to find a generalized harmonic gauge choice that is consistent with the AdS boundary conditions.
We explicitly write down the gauge choice that achieves this in terms of a specific choice of generalized harmonic source functions.
These preliminary results are a direct precursor to important specialized studies of AdS dynamics with no symmetry assumptions, most notably of gravitational collapse, and of the superradiant instability.

\section{Introduction}

In an unprecedented way, the simulation of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes has opened up the field of numerical relativity to the study of phenomena in areas beyond General Relativity (GR). 
At the heart of this push to understand AdS is a deep mathematical connection between gravity in AdS to certain conformal field theories (CFT), now known as the AdS/CFT correspondence~\cite{Maldacena:1997re,Gubser:1998bc,Witten:1998qj}. 
Through this connection, the study of AdS spacetimes has become immediately relevant to fundamental questions in many areas in physics, such as fluid dynamics [cite], relativistic heavy ion collisions [cite], and superconductivity [cite].
See, for example, [cite] for excellent reviews. 

The reason the study of AdS is crucial for our understanding of these phenomena is that AdS/CFT provides an important --and in most cases the only-- window into the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories far from equilibrium. 
The dynamical far-from-equilibrium regime is precisely the one that is least explored and understood, and the one that has the best chance of making contact with experiment.
Within GR, the dynamics of AdS provides a detailed look at how the Einstein equations behave in the fully non-linear regime and with non-trivial boundary conditions.
This has led to important progress in our understanding fundamental phenomena in gravity, such as gravitational collapse, black hole collisions, and superradiance. 

Our current understanding of AdS, however, remains limited. 
This is due to several reasons.
First, evolution in AdS is notoriously hard, in part because it is an initial boundary value problem whose systematic study is still in its infancy. 
Cauchy evolution in AdS requires data to be prescribed not only at an initial space-like hypersurface, but also at spatial and null infinity which constitute the time-like boundary of an asymptotically AdS spacetime.
Second, the most interesting phenomena involve spacetimes that have very little or no symmetry, making these evolutions beyond the reach of most numerical codes. 
Third, for many of these phenomena, there is a variety of physical scales that must be adequately resolved to capture the correct physics.

The main purpose of this article is to present the first proof-of-principle Cauchy evolution of asymptotically AdS spacetimes that has been achieved with no symmetry assumptions.
The results presented here are based on a code that solves the Einstein equations for asymptotically AdS spacetimes with a generalized harmonic evolution scheme, with adaptive mesh refinement capabilities. 
This code is the next step in an ongoing program initiated in \cite{Bantilan:2017kok} that uses Cartesian coordinates in global AdS, now enabled with a breakthrough set of generalized harmonic source functions that is crucial in successfully stabilizing evolution in AdS with no symmetries.

This article is organized as follows. 
In Section~\ref{sec:setup} we describe the setup, and in Section~\ref{sec:numerical_scheme} we outline the generalized harmonic scheme that we use in our simulations.
In Section~\ref{sec:gauge_choice} we explicitly write down our gauge choice in terms of a specific choice of generalized harmonic source functions that stabilizes these evolutions with no symmetry.
Section~\ref{sec:results} contains preliminary results from this new code, and we conclude with a discussion in Section~\ref{sec:Discussion}.



\section{Setup}\label{sec:setup}

\subsection{Anti-de Sitter Spacetime}\label{subsec:AdS}
The dynamics of gravity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in four dimensions coupled to a massless scalar field $\varphi$ can be described by the following action
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:action}
S = \int d^4 x \sqrt{-g} \left( \frac{1}{16\pi} \left( R - 2\Lambda \right) - g^{\alpha\beta} \partial_\alpha \varphi \partial_\beta \varphi \right),
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the Ricci scalar of the metric $g_{\alpha\beta}$ with determinant $g$.
Here, we use geometric units where Newton's constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1.
The variation of the action \eref{eqn:action} with respect to $g_{\alpha\beta}$ and $\varphi$ gives the equations of motion
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:eoms1}
R_{\alpha\beta} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\alpha\beta} + \Lambda g_{\alpha\beta} = 8\pi \left( \partial_\alpha \varphi \partial_\beta \varphi - g_{\alpha\beta} \frac{1}{2} g^{\gamma\delta} \partial_{\gamma} \varphi \partial_{\delta} \varphi \right),
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:eoms2}
g^{\alpha\beta} \nabla_{\alpha} \nabla_{\beta} \varphi = 0.
\end{equation}
The metric of AdS$_4$ is the maximally symmetric vacuum (i.e. $\varphi=0$) solution of \eref{eqn:eoms1},\eref{eqn:eoms2} in four dimensions.
In terms of global coordinates $(t,r,\theta,\phi)\in(-\infty,+\infty)\times(0,+\infty)\times[0,\pi)\times[0,2\pi)$ that cover the whole spacetime, the metric of AdS$_4$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ads4}
\hat{g}= \left( -(1+r^2/L^2) dt^2 + (1+r^2/L^2)^{-1} dr^2 +r^2 d{\Omega_2}^2 \right), \nonumber
\end{equation}
with a characteristic length scale $L$ that is related to the cosmological constant by $\Lambda = - 3/L^2$, and $d{\Omega_2}^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2$ is the metric of the round 2-sphere.

First, we compactify $r=2\rho/(1-\rho^2/\ell^2)$ so that the AdS boundary at $r \rightarrow +\infty$ is at a finite value of the new radial coordinate, $\rho=\ell$.
We hereafter set $\ell=1$ without loss of generality, so that the AdS boundary is $\rho=1$. In this way, we obtain (compactified) spherical coordinates $x^\alpha=(t,\rho,\theta,\phi)$.
Defining a convenient function $\hat{f}(\rho) = (1-\rho^2)^2+4\rho^2/L^2$, the metric of AdS$_4$ in this set of coordinates reads
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ads4_compact}
\hat{g}_{\alpha\beta}dx^{\alpha}dx^{\beta} = \frac{1}{(1-\rho^2)^2} \left( -\hat{f}(\rho) dt^2 + 4(1+\rho^2)^2 \hat{f}(\rho)^{-1} d\rho^2 + 4\rho^2 d{\Omega_2}^2 \right). \nonumber
\end{equation}

Second, we define Cartesian coordinates $x^\mu=(t,x,y,z)$ by $x=\rho\cos\theta$, $y=\rho\sin\theta\cos\phi$, $z=\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi$ where $\rho=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, in order to bypass the severe restriction on time step size at the origin $\rho=0$ of a grid in polar coordinates. 
This brings the metric of AdS$_4$ into its final form
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:ads4_final}
\hat{g}_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}=&\frac{1}{\left(1-\rho^2\right)^2 }\left( -dt^2 \hat{f}(\rho) +4\rho^{-2}\hat{f}(\rho)^{-1} \left(1+\rho^2\right)^2 (x dx + y dy + z dz)^2 \right. \nonumber \\
&+\frac{4}{\rho^2} \left[\left(-2 x y\right) dx dy + \left(- 2 y z\right) dy dz + \left(- 2 x z\right) dx dz \right. \nonumber \\
&\left. \left. + \left(y^2+z^2\right) dx^2 + \left(x^2+z^2\right) dy^2 + \left(x^2+y^2\right) dz^2 \right] \right),
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Boundary conditions for Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes}\label{subsec:asyAdS}
We will be interested in spacetimes whose asymptotic isometry group is the same as AdS, i.e. $SO(3,2)$. These are called asymptotically AdS spacetimes. In other words, we will require that the metric solution, written in the form $g=\hat{g}+h$, satisfies the asymptotic Killing equation in any set of coordinates, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:asyKilleq}
(\mathcal{L}_X g)_{\alpha\beta}=\mathcal{O}(h_{\alpha\beta})\;\;\;\; \textrm{near the AdS boundary at $\rho=1$},
\end{equation}
for any $X$ generator of $SO(3,2)$. \textcolor{blue}{In the following, we will refer to any set of coordinates in which the metric $g$ asymptotes to $\hat{g}$ in the form \eref{eqn:ads4_compact} as spherical coordinates (although they should be regarded as asymptotically spherical coordinates), and to any set of coordinates in which $g$ asymptotes to $\hat{g}$ in the form \eref{eqn:ads4_final} as Cartesian coordinates (although they should be regarded as asymptotically Cartesian coordinates).}

If we consider spherical coordinates, the solution to \eref{eqn:asyKilleq} gives the boundary conditions (see [cite 1201.2132] for the details)
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:sphbounconh}
h_{\rho\alpha}&=f_{\rho\alpha}(t,\theta,\phi)(1-\rho)^2+\mathcal{O}((1-\rho)^3) \;\; \textrm{ if $\alpha\neq\rho$}, \\ \nonumber
h_{\alpha\beta}&=f_{\alpha\beta}(t,\theta,\phi)(1-\rho)+\mathcal{O}((1-\rho)^{2}) \;\; \textrm{ otherwise},
\end{eqnarray}
(where $m,n=t,\theta,\phi$) for arbitrary functions $f_{\alpha\beta}(t,\theta,\phi)$. Furthermore, we impose a boundary condition on the massless scalar field $\varphi$ in order to preserve the asymptotics \eref{eq:sphbounconh} during evolution:
\begin{equation}
\varphi=b(t,\theta,\phi)(1-\rho)^3+\mathcal{O}((1-\rho)^4)
\end{equation}
for arbitrary $b(t,\theta,\phi)$.

In Cartesian coordinates, these become
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:carbouncondh}
h_{\mu\nu}&=&f_{\mu\nu}(t,x,y,z)|_{\rho(x,y,z)=1}(1-\rho(x,y,z))+\mathcal{O}((1-\rho(x,y,z))^{2}), \\
\label{eq:carbouncondphi}
\varphi&=&c(t,x,y,z)|_{\rho(x,y,z)=1}(1-\rho(x,y,z))^2+\mathcal{O}((1-\rho(x,y,z))^{3}), 
\end{eqnarray}
for arbitrary $f_{\mu\nu}$ and $c$.

\section{Numerical Scheme}\label{sec:numerical_scheme}

We solve the Einstein equations in generalized harmonic form~\cite{Pretorius:2004jg} with constraint damping, for asymptotically AdS spacetimes~\cite{Bantilan:2012vu}.
We discretize the resulting PDEs with second order finite differences, and integrate in time using an iterative Newton-Gauss-Seidel relaxation procedure. 
We use the PAMR/AMRD libraries \cite{PAMR} for running these simulations in parallel on Linux computing clusters and for adaptive mesh refinement support.
We obtain initial data using a multigrid algorithm built into the PAMR/AMRD libraries.
The numerical grid is in $(t,x,y,z)$ with $t \in [0,t_{max}]$, $x \in [-1,1]$, $y \in [-1,1], z \in [-1,1]$.
The typical grid resolution gives $N_x=N_y=N_z=217$ points in each of the Cartesian directions, with equal grid spacings $\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta z\equiv \Delta$.
We use a typical Courant factor of $\delta \equiv \Delta t / \Delta x = 0.15$.

We search for apparent horizons (AH) using a flow method, and use the excision method to evolve black hole spacetimes, thereby removing geometric singularities from the computational domain.
At the excision surface, the usual equations of motion are solved using one-sided stencils. 
Kreiss-Oliger dissipation~\cite{kreiss1973methods} is essential to damp unphysical high-frequency noise that arise at such grid boundaries, and we use a typical dissipation parameter of $\epsilon=0.35$.

%The evolved variables $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ are constructed out of the full metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and the pure AdS metric $\hat{g}_{\mu\nu}$ by $g_{\mu\nu} = \hat{g}_{\mu\nu} + \bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$. 
The evolved variables $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ are constructed out of the full metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ by considering the deviations from the pure AdS metric $h_{\mu\nu}=g_{\mu\nu} - \hat{g}_{\mu\nu}$ and stripping these of as many factors of $(1-\rho^2)$ as necessary so that they fall off linearly in $(1-\rho)$ near the AdS boundary $\rho=1$. %their leading order in the near-boundary expansion is $\mathcal{O}(q)$. 
From the boundary conditions \eref{eq:carbouncondh}, we immediately see that $h_{\mu\nu}=\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ in Cartesian coordinates, so $g_{\mu\nu} = \hat{g}_{\mu\nu}+\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$.
Similarly, the evolved scalar field variable $\bar{\varphi}$ is constructed out of a real scalar field $\varphi$ by
$\varphi = (1-\rho^2)^2 \bar{\varphi}$.
Following the same argument, the evolved source function variables $\bar{H}_\mu$ are constructed out of the full generalized harmonic source functions $H_\mu$ and the values they take on in pure AdS by $\hat{H}_\mu$ by $H_\mu = \hat{H}_\mu + (1-\rho^2) \bar{H}_\mu$.

%By construction, the evolved variables $\bar{g}_{\mu \nu}$, $\bar{\varphi}$, $\bar{H}_{\mu}$ all fall off linearly in $(1-\rho)$ near the AdS boundary $\rho=1$. 
For evolved variables defined in this way, the boundary conditions \eref{eq:carbouncond} can be easily imposed as reflective Dirichlet boundary conditions at the AdS boundary $\rho=1$.
%We set reflective Dirichlet boundary conditions at the AdS boundary $\rho=1$ for all evolved variables. 
The only complication comes from the fact that the simulations described here are performed in Cartesian coordinates $x,y,z$ in terms of which $\rho^2=x^2+y^2+z^2$, so the AdS boundary generally does not lie on a Cartesian grid point. 
For any given evolved variable, we thus take its Dirichlet boundary condition at $\rho=1$ and its values at points further to the interior $\rho<1$, and use these to set its value at grid points that are at most one grid point away from $\rho=1$ by linear interpolation. 



\section{Gauge Choice}\label{sec:gauge_choice}

Here we sketch the procedure for finding the generalized harmonic gauge choice that achieves stable Cauchy 3+1 evolution in for asymptotically AdS$_4$ spacetimes.
For a more detailed discussion in a simpler context with more symmetry, see~\cite{Bantilan:2012vu}. 
The first step involves expanding the evolved variables $\bar{g}_{\mu \nu}$, $\bar{H}_{\mu}$, $\bar{\varphi}$ in power series about $(1-\rho) \equiv q = 0$
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:qexp}
\bar{g}_{\mu \nu} &=& \bar{g}_{(1) \mu \nu} q + \bar{g}_{(2) \mu \nu} q^2 + \bar{g}_{(3) \mu \nu} q^3 + \mathcal{O}(q^4) \nonumber \\
\bar{H}_{\mu} &=& \bar{H}_{(1) \mu} q + \bar{H}_{(2) \mu} q^2 + \bar{H}_{(3) \mu} q^3 + \mathcal{O}(q^4) \nonumber \\
\bar{\varphi} &=& \bar{\varphi}_{(1)} q + \bar{\varphi}_{(2)} q^2 + \bar{\varphi}_{(3)} q^3 + \mathcal{O}(q^4). 
\end{eqnarray}

In terms of the expansion coefficients that appear in \eref{eqn:qexp}, the Einstein equations near $q=0$ are
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:efett}

\end{eqnarray}

In the generalized harmonic formulation, choosing a gauge amounts to choosing a set of generalized harmonic source functions $H_\mu$. 
As long as the generalized harmonic constraints \eref{eqn:ct}-\eref{eqn:cz} are satisfied, a gauge choice that explicitly eliminates all order $q^{-2}$ terms that appear in \eref{eqn:efett}-\eref{eqn:efezz} has leading order coefficients that satisfy
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:target_gauge_xyz}
\bar{H}_{(1)x}&=&\frac{3}{2\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x \bar{g}_{(1)xx}+y\bar{g}_{(1)xy}+z\bar{g}_{(1)xz}) \nonumber \\
\bar{H}_{(1)y}&=&\frac{3}{2\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x \bar{g}_{(1)xy}+y\bar{g}_{(1)yy}+z\bar{g}_{(1)yz}) \nonumber \\
\bar{H}_{(1)z}&=&\frac{3}{2\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x \bar{g}_{(1)xz}+y\bar{g}_{(1)yz}+z\bar{g}_{(1)zz}).
\end{eqnarray}
This can be immediately seen from the fact that the $q^{-2}$ order of $\tilde{\Box}\bar{g}_{(1)t\mu}$ for $\mu\neq t$ is proportional to the leading order of $C_t$ (for any choice of $\bar{H}_\mu$) while, for our particular choice of $\bar{H}_\mu$, the $q^{-2}$ order of the remaining $\tilde{\Box}\bar{g}_{(1)\mu\nu}$ and the leading order of $C_x,C_y,C_z$ depend only on the factor $\bar{g}_{(1)tt}-\bar{g}_{(1)xx}-\bar{g}_{(1)yy}-\bar{g}_{(1)zz}$.

Finally, for the t-component we choose
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:target_gauge_t}
\bar{H}_{(1)t}=\frac{3}{2\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}(x \bar{g}_{(1)tx}+y\bar{g}_{(1)ty}+z\bar{g}_{(1)tz}),
\end{equation}
which makes the leading order of \eref{eqn:ct} vanish trivially.
This is the asymptotic gauge condition that we have empirically verified to lead to stable 3+1 evolution. Notice that this choice does not fix the value of $H_\mu$ in the bulk.

\subsection{Boundary stress-energy tensor}
\label{sec:bouset2}

In the code we output the components of the stress-energy tensor of the CFT at the time-like AdS boundary. We do this in spherical coordinates $x^\alpha=(t,\rho,\theta,\phi)$, defined in the usual way in terms of the Cartesian coordinates used in the code, as they are adapted to the AdS boundary.
We compute this by first computing the quasi-local stress-energy tensor $^{(q)}T_{\alpha\beta}$ at a time-like hypersurface $\partial M_q$ at fixed $q=1-\rho$, following the prescription in  [CITE hep-th/9902121]. We have
\begin{equation}
^{(q)}T_{\alpha\beta}=\frac{1}{8\pi}\biggl(\;   \Theta_{\alpha\beta}-\Theta \gamma_{\alpha\beta}-\frac{2}{L}\gamma_{\alpha\beta}+L \;G_{\alpha\beta} \biggr),
\end{equation}
where $\Theta_{\alpha\beta}=-\gamma^\alpha_{\mu}\gamma^\beta_\nu\nabla_{(\alpha}S_{\beta)}$ is the extrinsic curvature of $\partial M_q$, $\gamma_{\mu\nu}=g_{\mu\nu}-S_\mu S_\nu$ is the induced metric on $\partial M_q$, $S^\mu$ is the spacelike, outward pointing unit vector normal to $\partial M_q$ and $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor defined on $\partial M_q$. (Notice the different minus sign in the last term w.r.t. to  [CITE hep-th/9902121] ). We will be interested in the value of $^{(q)}T_{\mu\nu}$ for $q$ close to 0, i.e. near the boundary.
Restricting to the 3 coordinates on the AdS boundary at $\rho=1$, i.e. $x^i=(t,\theta,\phi)$, this enables us to compute the boundary stress-energy tensor as
\begin{equation}
\langle T_{ij}\rangle_{CFT}=\lim_{q\to0}\frac{1}{q}  \;^{(q)}T_{ij}.
\end{equation}

From $^{(q)}T_{\mu\nu}$ we also compute the AdS mass as follows [CITE hep-th/9902121]. At each time $t$ of evolution, we take a spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma$ in $\partial M_q$, with induced 3-metric $\sigma_{\mu\nu}=\Sigma_{\mu\nu}-u_\mu u_\nu$, where $u^\mu$ is the future pointing unit vector normal to $\Sigma$ in $\partial M_q$, lapse $N$ and shift $N^i$. The AdS mass is
\begin{equation}
M_{AdS}=\lim_{q\to0}\int_\Sigma d\theta d\phi \sqrt{\sigma} N ( ^{(q)}T_{\mu\nu} u^\mu u^\nu).
\end{equation}

We display these quantities in terms of the barred metric variables in spherical coordinates $\bar{g}_{\alpha\beta}$, which are defined similarly to the definition of Cartesian barred metric variables $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ in Section~\ref{sec:numerical_scheme}: we consider the deviation from pure AdS in spherical coordinates, $h_{\alpha\beta}=g_{\alpha\beta}-\bar{g}_{\alpha\beta}$, stripped of as many factors of $(1-\rho^2)$ as necessary to make their fall off near the boundary linear in $q$. Notice that $\bar{g}_{\alpha\beta}$ and $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ are not in general components of the same tensor, therefore the usual transformation between tensor components in different sets of coordinates cannot be applied. The correct transformation can be easily deduced from \eref{eq:sphbouncondh} and \eref{eq:carbouncondh}: $\bar{g}_{\rho\alpha}=\frac{1}{(1-\rho^2)}\frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial \rho}\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial x^\alpha}\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ if $\alpha\neq\rho$, $\bar{g}_{\alpha\beta}=\frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial x^\beta}\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ otherwise.
In terms of the leading order coefficient of $\bar{g}_{\alpha\beta}$, we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle T_{tt}\rangle_{CFT}&=&\frac{1}{16\pi} \biggl(2\bar{g}_{(1)\rho\rho}+3\bar{g}_{(1)\theta\theta}+3\frac{\bar{g}_{(1)\phi\phi}}{\sin^2\theta}\biggr) \nonumber \\
\langle T_{t\theta}\rangle_{CFT}&=&\frac{3}{16\pi}\bar{g}_{(1)t\theta} \nonumber \\
\langle T_{t\phi}\rangle_{CFT}&=&\frac{3}{16\pi}\bar{g}_{(1)t\phi} \nonumber \\
\langle T_{\theta\theta}\rangle_{CFT}&=&\frac{1}{16\pi} \biggl(3\bar{g}_{(1)tt}-2\bar{g}_{(1)\rho\rho}-3\frac{\bar{g}_{(1)\phi\phi}}{\sin^2\theta}\biggr) \nonumber \\
\langle T_{\theta\phi}\rangle_{CFT}&=&\frac{3}{16\pi}\bar{g}_{(1)\theta\phi} \nonumber \\
\langle T_{\phi\phi}\rangle_{CFT}&=&\frac{\sin^2\theta}{16\pi} (3\bar{g}_{(1)tt}-2\bar{g}_{(1)\rho\rho}-3\bar{g}_{(1)\theta\theta}) \nonumber \\
M_{AdS}&=&\int_0^\pi d\theta \int_0^{2\pi}d\phi\frac{\sin\theta}{16\pi} \biggl(2\bar{g}_{(1)\rho\rho}+3\bar{g}_{(1)\theta\theta}+3\frac{\bar{g}_{(1)\phi\phi}}{\sin^2\theta}\biggr) \nonumber. \\
\end{eqnarray}

One useful quantity to compute is the trace of the stress-energy tensor, $\langle trT\rangle_{CFT}=\gamma^{ij} \langle T_{ij}\rangle_{CFT}$, where $\gamma=-dt^2+d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2$ is the conformal metric at the AdS boundary. We obtain
\begin{equation}
\langle trT\rangle_{CFT}=\frac{3}{8\pi}\biggl(\bar{g}_{(1)tt}-\bar{g}_{(1)\rho\rho}-\bar{g}_{(1)\theta\theta}-\frac{\bar{g}_{(1)\phi\phi}}{\sin^2\theta}\biggr)
\end{equation}
If we convert the spherical quantities into Cartesian ones (and we evaluate the expression at $\rho=1$), we see that $\langle trT\rangle_{CFT}$ depends only on the factor $\bar{g}_{(1)tt}-\bar{g}_{(1)xx}-\bar{g}_{(1)yy}-\bar{g}_{(1)zz}$, as for $C_x,C_y,C_z$. This is an important sanity check: the validity of the generalized harmonic constraints analitycally ensures the vanishing of the trace of the boundary stress-energy tensor, as expected for the boundary CFT.
Another important test that we performed is conservation of the analytic form of $\langle T_{ij}\rangle_{CFT}$. The proof of this is conceptually straightforward but lenghty, so it is not presented here. We will instead show below that conservation is preserved numerically during evolution. Since this test is computationally expensive, we will do it only for 4 representative time steps.

Since the AdS boundary generally does not lie on points of the Cartesian grid, to obtain the values of boundary quantities we use extrapolation from bulk point values (see~\ref{sec:extrapconvbdy} for the details on how this is implemented). In particular, we use first order extrapolation as this is the one that gives the best approximation for $<trT>_{CFT}$, as shown in Fig. [$L^2$ norm of trace for first, second and third order extrapolation].

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:Discussion}

\textcolor{blue}{The calculation just outlined would be almost identical if we were to study 3+1 Cartesian evolution of asymptotically AdS spacetimes in any $d\geq4$ dimensions. In particular, the stable gauge found with this method would be the same up to a numerical factor. Even more interestingly, perhaps, a comparison between \eref{eqn:target_gauge_xyz},\eref{eqn:target_gauge_t} and the corresponding result in [cite arXiv:1706.04199 [hep-th] ] (see eq. (S10) ) clearly suggests a trend for the expression of the stable gauge in $D+1$ dimensions for any number $D\geq1$ of spatial dimensions. If this trend were confirmed, repeating the calculation above would not be necessary when changing the value of $D$.}

\section{Generalized Harmonic Formulation}

The generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations is based on coordinates $x^\mu$ that each satisfies a wave equation $\Box x^{\mu}=H^\mu$ with source functions $H^\mu$.
As long as the constraint $0=C^\mu \equiv H^\mu-\Box x^\mu$ is satisfied, we can then write the trace-reversed Einstein equations in $d$ dimensions with cosmological constant $\Lambda$
\begin{equation}
0=R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{2\Lambda}{d-2} g_{\mu\nu} - 8\pi\left( T_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{d-2} T g_{\mu\nu} \right)
\end{equation}
as
\begin{eqnarray}
0
&=& R_{\mu\nu} - \nabla_{(\mu} C_{\nu)} - \frac{2\Lambda}{d-2} g_{\mu\nu} - 8\pi\left( T_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{d-2} {T^\alpha}_\alpha g_{\mu\nu} \right) \nonumber \\
&=& R_{\mu\nu} - \nabla_{(\mu} H_{\nu)} + \nabla_{(\mu} \Box{x}_{\nu)} - \frac{2\Lambda}{d-2} g_{\mu\nu} - 8\pi\left( T_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{d-2} {T^\alpha}_\alpha g_{\mu\nu} \right) \nonumber \\
&=& -\frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha\beta} g_{\mu\nu,\alpha\beta} - g^{\alpha\beta}{}_{,(\mu}g_{\nu)\alpha,\beta} - H_{(\mu,\nu)} + H_\alpha \Gamma^\alpha{}_{\mu\nu} \nonumber \\
&&- \Gamma^\alpha{}_{\mu\beta}\Gamma^\beta{}_{\alpha\nu} - \frac{2\Lambda}{d-2} g_{\mu\nu} - 8\pi\left( T_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{d-2} {T^\alpha}_\alpha g_{\mu\nu} \right) \nonumber,
\end{eqnarray}
where the choice of $H_\mu = g_{\mu\nu} H^\nu$ constitutes a gauge choice. 
To suppress constraint-violating solutions that do not satisfy $C_\mu=0$, we supplement with constraint-damping terms as introduced in~\cite{Gundlach:2005eh} and obtain our final form of the Einstein equations
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:efe_gh_modified}
&-& \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha \beta} g_{\mu \nu, \alpha \beta} - 
{g^{\alpha \beta}}_{,(\mu} g_{\nu) \alpha, \beta} - H_{(\mu, \nu)} + H_\alpha {\Gamma^\alpha}_{\mu \nu} \nonumber \\
&-& {\Gamma^\alpha}_{\beta \mu} {\Gamma^\beta}_{\alpha \nu} - \kappa \left( 2 n_{(\mu} C_{\nu)} - (1+P) g_{\mu \nu} n^\alpha 
C_\alpha \right) \nonumber \\
&=&   \frac{2}{d-2} \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} + 8\pi \left( T_{\mu \nu} - 
\frac{1}{d-2} {T^\alpha}_\alpha g_{\mu \nu} \right).
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Regularized Metric Variables in Cartesian and Spherical coordinates}\label{sec:regmetvarcarsph}

\section{Convergence Tests in the Bulk}\label{sec:convbulk}

Here we display a pair of numerical tests that demonstrate convergence trends for a representative simulation with no mesh refinement.
We do this for [pick simulation] with initial data parameters [display parameters]

Let us denote the value of the field $f$ at the point $(t,x,y,z)$ in a simulation with mesh spacing $\Delta$ by $f_\Delta(t,x,y,z)$.
To show that the solution $f_\Delta(t,x,y,z)$ converges to a function $f(t,x,y,z)$ in the continuum limit $\Delta\rightarrow0$, we compute the rate of convergence $Q(t,x,y,z)$ at each point of interest
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qconv}
Q(t,x,y,z)=\frac{1}{\ln(3/2)}\ln\left( \frac{f_{9h/4}(t,x,y,z)-f_{3h/2}(t,x,y,z)}{f_{3h/2}(t,x,y,z)-f_{h}(t,x,y,z)} \right).
\end{equation}
We use second-order accurate finite difference stencils, and there is a factor of 3/2 between successive resolutions.
Thus, we expect $Q$ to asymptote to $Q=2$ in the limit $\Delta\rightarrow0$.

To show that the solution is converging to a solution of the Einstein equations, we compute an independent residual. 
This is obtained by taking the numerical solution and substituting it into a discretized version of
the Einstein equations, a component of which we denote $\Phi_\Delta$. 
The independent residual should be purely numerical truncation error, so we can compute a convergence factor for it by using only two resolutions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qires}
Q_{EFE}(t,x,y,z)=\frac{1}{\ln(3/2)}\ln\left( \frac{\Phi_{3h/2}(t,x,y,z)}{\Phi_{h}(t,x,y,z)} \right).
\end{equation}
Again, with second-order accurate finite difference stencils and with a factor of 3/2 between successive resolutions, we expect $Q$ to approach $Q=2$ as $\Delta\rightarrow0$.

\section{Extrapolation Technique and Convergence at AdS Boundary}\label{sec:extrapconvbdy}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:results}, given a Cartesian grid with spacing $\Delta$, since the AdS boundary generally does not lie on points of the grid, we can only obtain the approximated value $f^{bdy}_{\Delta}$ of any boundary quantity $f$ through extrapolation, using the numerical values of $f$ on grid points near the boundary, which we denote by $f_\Delta$. In this Section we describe how grid points are chosen for extrapolation and we show convergence by computing the factor \eref{eq:qconv} for $f^{bdy}_{\Delta}$ at boundary points, which is a consequence of bulk convergence (see ~\ref{sec:convbulk}) at the chosen points.

If we wish to test convergence of $f^{bdy}_{\Delta}$ in the continuum limit $\Delta\rightarrow0$, there are two crucial criteria for the choice of grid points that are \emph{suitable} for extrapolation. We will now explain them with the help of Fig.~\ref{fig:lego_circle}, which shows an example of the result of the application of these criteria in the first quadrant of a $z=const.$ surface of the grid for first order extrapolation.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Consider the value of $f^{bdy}_{\Delta}$ at any boundary point $p_{bdy}$. If we obtain this by $n^{th}-$order extrapolation, $f^{bdy}_{\Delta}(p_{bdy})$ is a combination of the values $f_\Delta(p_1),f_\Delta(p_2),\dots,f_\Delta(p_{n+1})$ (where $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_{n+1}$ are the bulk points used for extrapolation) multiplied by factors that depend on the coordinates of $p_{bdy},p_1,\dots,p_{n_{\Delta}+1}$. Therefore, we can write  $f^{bdy}_{\Delta}(p_{bdy})=f(p_{bdy})+c_{extr}(p_{bdy},p_1,p_2,\dots,p_{n+1})+c_\Delta(p_1,p_2,\dots,p_{n+1})\Delta^2$ where the first term is the true value of $f$ at $p_{bdy}$, the second term is the error due to the extrapolation approximation and the third term is the error coming from the numerical error in $f_\Delta$. From this we immediately see that the convergence factor \eref{eq:qconv} at point $p_{bdy}$ can be expected to asymptote to 2 as $\Delta\rightarrow0$ only if the points $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_{n+1}$ are the same for all 3 resolutions involved.
 
 \item For each resolution, grid points with $\rho\geq 1-\Delta/2$ (points outside the dotted line in Fig.~\ref{fig:lego_circle}) are excised due to the fact that some quantities diverge at $\rho=1$, the value of functions at points with $1-3\Delta/2\leq \rho < 1-\Delta/2$ (points between the dotted line and the dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:lego_circle}) are set by using forward/backward stencils, and the value of functions at points with $1-5\Delta/2\leq \rho < 1-3\Delta/2$ (between the dashed line and the continuous blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:lego_circle}) are set by using centred stencils which, however, use neighbouring points set by forward/backward stencils. For all these reasons, we can only expect convergence if we pick grid points with  $\rho<1-5\Delta/2$ (inside the continuous blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:lego_circle}).
 \end{enumerate}
Furthermore, among the points satisfying (i) and (ii), we want the ones that are closest to the boundary in order for extrapolation to provide a more accurate approximation.

\begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=6.0in,clip=true]{plots/lego_circle/Lego_circle.pdf}
\parbox{5.0in}{\caption{Visual description of first order extrapolation technique in the first quadrant of a $z=const.$ surface for the lowest resolution, with grid spacing $\Delta$, among the three involved in a convergence test ($const.$ is chosen as the $z-$coordinate value of one of the points common to all three resolutions). We show a typical example in which common points are 4 grid points away from each other along each direction.
        }\label{fig:lego_circle}}
\end{figure}
 
Once suitable points have been found (the green dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:lego_circle}), the extrapolation technique proceeds as follows:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item consider the first suitable point, $p_1$, and identify the coordinate with the largest value, e.g. $x$, and its sign, e.g. $x>0$. If two coordinates have the same value, then we pick $x$ over $y$ or $z$ and $y$ over $z$.
 \item take the next $n$ points, $p_2,\dots,p_{n+1}$, used for $n^{th}-$order extrapolation along the identified axis ($x$ in our example) in the direction of the bulk (decreasing $x$ in the example), making sure that they also satisfy (i) ((ii) is trivially satisfied by construction). For the case of first order extrapolation, each $p_2$ is represented in yellow in Fig.~\ref{fig:lego_circle}.
 \item use $n^{th}-$ order extrapolation on $f_\Delta(p_1),\dots,f_\Delta(p_{n+1})$ to determine the value of $f^{bdy}_{\Delta}(p_{bdy})$ where $p_{bdy}$ is the boundary point along the identified axis in the direction of the boundary (one of the red dots in Fig. ~\ref{fig:lego_circle}). In our example, $p_{bdy}$ is the point with coordinates $(x,y,z)=(\sqrt{1-y(p_1)^2-z(p_1)^2},y(p_1),z(p_1))$.
 \item repeat the previous steps until the last suitable point.
 \end{itemize}

CONVERGENCE PLOTS

This extrapolation scheme is validated by Figure [CONVERGENCE], which shows second-order convergence at the boundary for CHOSEN FUNCTION with this extrapolation scheme, as expected from having second-order convergence in the bulk (see ~\ref{sec:convbulk}) at all points used for extrapolation.

Notice, from the discussion in (i), that we do not expect to converge to the true value $f(p_{bdy})$ of a boundary quantity in the continuum limit $\Delta\rightarrow0$, but rather to $f(p_{bdy})+c_{extr}(p_{bdy},p_1,p_2,\dots,p_{n+1})$.
For this reason, the convergence test \eref{eq:qires} cannot be performed at the boundary for functions with true value 0 (such as $\langle trT \rangle_{CFT}$), because their extrapolated value is not just the term linear in $\Delta^2$ but it also includes the extrapolation error $c_{extr}$.
